# Booking Rate Choices by Customer Segments

## Gender-Based Analysis
Our hotel serves a male-dominated customer base with significant unknown demographics:
<BarChart 
    data={gender_distribution}
    x=gender
    y=total_bookings
    y2SeriesType=line
    y2=percentage
    y2Fmt=pct2
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

<DataTable data={gender_distribution} >
  <Column id=gender />
  <Column id=total_bookings />
  <Column id=percentage fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

### Rate Preferences by Gender

<Heatmap 
    data={gender_rate_preferences} 
    x=gender 
    y=booking_rate 
    value=percentage_within_gender 
    valueFmt=pct 
/>

Male guests prioritize flexibility, while female guests show more price sensitivity. Unknown guests follow entirely different booking patterns, likely representing corporate or agent bookings rather than individual travelers.

**Male Guests - Flexibility Focused**
- Fully Flexible rate dominates at 58.15% of male bookings
- Clear preference for maximum booking flexibility over discounts

**Female Guests - Balanced Approach**
- Fully Flexible rate leads at 46.94% but less dominant than males
- Non-Refundable rates at 18.33% - significantly higher than males (9.50%)
- More price-conscious, willing to accept restrictions for better rates

**Unknown Gender - Early Planning**
- Early-60 days rate dominates at 49.53% - dramatically different pattern
- Fully Flexible secondary at 27.07%
- Suggests advance corporate booking or travel agent reservations


## Age Group Analysis
**60.78% of bookings have unknown age data**, limiting the reliability of age-based insights. Among known ages:

<BarChart 
    data={age_distribution}
    x=age_group
    y=total_bookings
    sort=false
    y2SeriesType=line
    y2=percentage
    y2Fmt=pct2
    y2Max=1
    y2Min=0
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

<DataTable data={age_distribution} >
  <Column id=age_group />
  <Column id=total_bookings />
  <Column id=percentage fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

### Rate Preferences by Age

<Heatmap 
    data={age_rate_preferences} 
    x=age_group 
    y=booking_rate 
    value=percentage_within_age_group
    valueFmt=pct 
/>

While all age groups prioritize flexibility, younger travelers show highest price sensitivity, while older travelers prefer advance planning discounts. However, the large proportion of unknown age data (60.78%) limits the reliability of these insights for business decision-making.

**Consistent Flexibility Preference Across All Ages**
- All age groups prefer Fully Flexible rates (44-55% within each group)
- Young travelers (0-25) most price-sensitive: 24.36% choose Non-Refundable rates
- Middle-aged travelers (25-45): Balanced between flexibility and discounts

**Data Reliability Limitations**
Age groups 55+ have insufficient sizes for reliable business insights:
- 55-65 group: Only 65 total bookings
- Over 65 group: Only 16 total bookings

Pattern suggestions for these groups (older travelers preferring early booking discounts) cannot be considered reliable for business decision-making.

## Nationality Analysis
Our hotel attracts a diverse international clientele, though 43.82% have unknown nationality:

<BarChart 
    data={nationality_distribution}
    x=nationality_code
    y=total_bookings
    y2SeriesType=line
    y2=percentage
    y2Fmt=pct2
    y2Max=1
    y2Min=0
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

<DataTable data={nationality_distribution} >
  <Column id=nationality_code />
  <Column id=total_bookings />
  <Column id=percentage fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

### Rate Preferences by Nationality

<Heatmap 
    data={nationality_rate_preferences} 
    x=nationality_code
    y=booking_rate 
    value=percentage_within_nationality
    valueFmt=pct 
/>

With 43.82% unknown nationality data and several countries having small sample sizes (46-72 bookings), insights for smaller markets should be considered preliminary. Business decisions should focus on the larger markets (US, GB and DE).

**European Guests -  Flexibility Seekers**
- German guests lead flexibility preference at 71.43% Fully Flexible (154 bookings)
- Czech guests at 76.12% (67 bookings) and Slovak guests at 63.89% (72 bookings) Fully Flexible
- British guests show high flexibility demand at 65.24% (187 bookings)

**US Guests - Balanced Value Approach**
- Fully Flexible preferred at 44.86% but significantly lower than Europeans
- Higher price sensitivity: 16.05% choose Non-Refundable rates
- Unique preference for Direct Booking rates at 7.82% (highest among all nationalities)


## Business Segment Analysis
Business segments are relatively balanced across our hotel's distribution channels:

<BarChart 
    data={business_segment_distribution}
    x=business_segment
    y=total_bookings
    y2SeriesType=line
    y2=percentage
    y2Fmt=pct2
    y2Max=1
    y2Min=0
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

<DataTable data={business_segment_distribution} >
  <Column id=business_segment />
  <Column id=total_bookings />
  <Column id=percentage fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

### Rate Preferences by Business Segment

<Heatmap 
    data={business_segment_rate_preferences} 
    x=business_segment
    y=booking_rate 
    value=percentage_within_age_group
    valueFmt=pct 
/>

- OTA channels drive flexibility demand - guests pay premium when unable to contact hotel directly
- FIT travelers most price-sensitive - plan ahead for discounts
- Corporate segments balance flexibility with advance planning
- Leisure travelers show most diverse booking patterns

# Online Check-in Analysis
## Overall Adoption Challenge
Online check-in adoption is critically low at just 5.92%, indicating significant barriers to digital adoption or limited system availability:

<DataTable data={online_checkin_overall} >
  <Column id=total_booking />
  <Column id=online_checkins />
  <Column id=online_checkins_rate fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

## By Business Segment

<BarChart 
    data={online_checkin_by_business_segment}
    x=business_segment
    y=total_booking
    y2SeriesType=line
    y2=online_checkin_rate
    y2Fmt=pct2
    y2Max=1
    y2Min=0
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

<DataTable data={online_checkin_by_business_segment} >
  <Column id=business_segment />
  <Column id=total_booking />
  <Column id=online_checkin_rate fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

**OTA Channels Lead Digital Adoption**
- OTAs: 9.07% online check-in rate (562 total bookings)
- OTA Netto: 7.80% online check-in rate (551 total bookings)
- Leisure: 8.42% online check-in rate (499 total bookings)

**Traditional Channels Show Resistance**
- Direct Business: 2.20% online check-in rate (318 total bookings)
- FIT: 0.97% online check-in rate (516 total bookings) - surprisingly lowest
- Film: 0% online check-in rate (55 total bookings)

## By Gender
There's a consistent low adoption accross genders:

<BarChart 
    data={online_checkin_by_gender}
    x=gender
    y=total_booking
    y2SeriesType=line
    y2=online_checkin_rate
    y2Fmt=pct2
    y2Max=1
    y2Min=0
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

<DataTable data={online_checkin_by_gender} >
  <Column id=gender />
  <Column id=total_booking />
  <Column id=online_checkin_rate fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

Unknown guests never use online check-in, likely representing corporate bookings or travel agent reservations where end guests handle their own check-in.

## Online Check-in by Weekday
Saturday shows the highest online check-in adoption rate at 12.33%, though this is based on a small denominator of only 146 total bookings.

<BarChart 
    data={online_checkin_by_weekday}
    x=weekday
    y=total_booking
    y2SeriesType=line
    y2=online_checkin_rate
    sort=false
    y2Fmt=pct2
    y2Max=1
    y2Min=0
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

<DataTable data={online_checkin_by_weekday} >
  <Column id=weekday />
  <Column id=total_booking />
  <Column id=online_checkin_rate fmt=pct2 />
</DataTable>

The small denominator (148 total online check-ins) makes detailed analysis unreliable:
- Saturday's high rate based on only 18 online check-ins
- Daily variations likely represent statistical noise rather than meaningful patterns
- Not enough data for confident business decisions

# Average Night Revenue per Occupied Capacity Analysis
## Methodology
Average night revenue per occupied capacity calculated as:
> (night_cost_sum / night_count) / occupied_space_sum

This metric provides the average night revenue per single occupied capacity unit (bed/space), normalizing for both stay length and room capacity to enable true profitability comparison across guest segments.

## By Gender

<DataTable data={revenue_per_capacity_by_gender} >
  <Column id=gender />
  <Column id=avg_night_revenue_per_occupied_capacity />
  <Column id=bookings />
  <Column id=percentage_booking fmt=pct />
</DataTable>

While female guests show the highest revenue per capacity, they represent only 14.4% of total bookings (360 out of 2,501), making this the smallest size among the 3 gender segments. Male guests drive volume with 51.8% of bookings, while Unknown guests represent 33.8% with significantly lower profitability.

## Cross-Segment Analysis: Gender × Business Segment

<BubbleChart 
    data={revenue_per_capacity_by_gender_business}
    x=total_bookings
    y=avg_night_revenue_per_capacity
    yFmt=usd0
    series=gender_business_segment
    size=total_revenue
    scaleTo=1.2
    xMin=0
    chartAreaHeight=350
/>

 - Male OTAs and Male OTA Nette appear as the largest bubbles in the high-volume, high-profitability quadrant.
 - Female guests consistently outperform across all business segments despite representing smaller booking volumes.
 - Unknown segments systematically underperform, particularly in FIT and Film channels.


### Most Profitable Guest Segments
- **Female Leisure travelers**: $63.46 per night per capacity (72 bookings, 2.88% of total bookings, $38.7K total revenue)
- **Female OTA guests**: $62.82 per night per capacity (77 bookings, 3.08% of total bookings, $41K total revenue)
- **Male OTA guests**: $59.24 per night per capacity (477 bookings, 19.07% of total bookings, $282K total revenue)

### Least Profitable Guest Segments
- **Unknown Film segment**: $4.18 per night per capacity (16 bookings, 0.64% of total bookings, $18.3K total revenue)
- **Unknown FIT travelers**: $13.47 per night per capacity (340 bookings, 13.59% of total bookings, $68.3K total revenue)
